# Random-Forest_Iris
This Random Forest Classifier is written with Scikit-learn, and trained using perhaps the best known database in pattern 
recognition literature the Iris data set (See https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). Enjoy! 
# Random-Forest_Gene_Data
This Random Forest Classifer (RF CLassifier) is written with Scikit-learn, and trained using tabular gene data (w/ 608 features, 871 samples, labels as "0" or "1" for each sample) to deter whether certain gene types are expressive or inhibatory?  Using this RF Classifier, I determined which of nine forest types (e.g., 500, 1000, or 2000 trees, and 12, 24, or 48 sample selections per decision) is best based upon metrics including- Confusion Matrices, MDI based feature ranking, F1 score, OOB score, Accuracy, ROC/AUC analysis.
